# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project build in Vanilla Javascript. It is country guide app.
In this project I used the fetch method to request data from a server.
* Server I used: https://restcountries.com/

To use this app just enter the name of your country and click enter on your keyboard.
